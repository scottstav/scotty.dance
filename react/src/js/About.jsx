	hello this is scott. my job is to develop software. i base too much of my identity in the music i listen to. i wish i spent more time outside. sometimes, programming makes me happy. my biggest fear is that my life will never be fully integrated with my desire to create. i feel best when i am serving people. i am looking for something important to do.
