# Typing Game (formerly Code Blocks)

this game used to be called Code Blocks. but now it uses words from http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/pocket.txt instead of lines of code so that name doesn't really make sense.


**team:** [kurt king](https://github.com/kurtaking), [paco huerta](https://github.com/PacoHuerta), [susan taylor](https://github.com/susan-taylor)
	



## How to Play
* have java installed
* download the [zip file](/code_blocks/code_blocks.zip)
* run code_blocks_2.jar
* start game and type the words to ward off the ships

#### **when the boss arrives**

	* type the words that appear under the bosses ship
	* be sure to defend yourself from the bosses lasers
	* defeat the boss and gain 1 of 3 power ups 
* type "power up" in the text box to use the power up
* see how many points you can get!
