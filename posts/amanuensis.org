* Milan Kundera on Weakness
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It was vertigo. A heady, insuperable longing to fall. We might also call vertigo
the intoxication of the weak. Aware of his weakness, a man decides to give in
rather than stand up to it. He is drunk with weakness, wishes to grow even
weaker, wishes to fall down in the middle of the main square in front of
everybody, wishes to be down, lower than down.
